The NABU PC is one of the first network-connected home computers. While the NABU Network went dark (along with the company) in 1985, many NABU Network Adapter (data modems) still exist.
This project modulates data that, when connected to the cable input of a NABU Network Adapter, allows data to be provided to the NABU PC just the way it was in the early 1980s.
